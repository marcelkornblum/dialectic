This document details the technologies in use on the client-side part of the project. For an overview of the system as a whole please see [this document](../docs/SYSTEM.md).

# Philosophy

We aim to create a system based entirely on free, open source, standards-based technologies. We intend to use modern W3C technologies exclusively.

Being right at the beginning of the process, some or all of these technology choices may be changed at a later date.

The aim will be to keep all software and libraries up to date as far as possible, and especially with regard to minor versions which ought to be updated regularly.

# Framework

To start with, we will be using AngularJS, along with several helper libraries (detailed on the [Credits](../docs/CREDITS.md) page). We may also use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and/or [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

# Development setup

The development process for the Front End part of this project will use [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

To get started with a development environment, see the [Developing](../docs/DEVELOPING.md) page.
